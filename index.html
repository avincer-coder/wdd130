        <p>
          My name is Mario I like to study, swim, eat and sleep!! I play video games in my free time with my high school friends. Sometimes I also help some of them learn English for their jobs or for their schools, most of them have already finished college and ask me for help to learn English. I'm not the greatest at that language but I try do the best I can and help them according to my possibilities.

          I also like to do sports. I go to the gym every day during the week. It is a goal that I have to not miss a single day except Sundays because they are the sabath days. I have been learning to play the guitar, I really like music so much that I'm also trying to learn to sing. On Tuesdays and Thursdays afternoons I go to salsa classes, I love to dance!

        <h2>México, Hidalgo </h2>

        <p>
          In Hidalgo, the atmosphere you breathe transmits the value of the ancient cultures settled in their lands; passages of history that give it a complex mosaic of alternatives to know. It has a vast historical and cultural tradition whose great material and immaterial wealth is manifested through its monuments, paintings, dances, music, food, languages and customs. 🌮
          There is a great variety of dishes in popular food such as nopales with eggs, beans with epazote, chicken or mutton mixiote, but the main one is the Hidalgo caviar, escamoles (ant eggs) 🐜.
